                <h3>The Ultimate Goal: Peace</h3>
                <p>It’s an irony but true at the same time. We feel like life is eternal. Nah! I’m not going to tell you
                    how shallow life is? Instead, I’m gonna tell you how shallow and deep we are and that too at the
                    same time. Doesn’t seem to make sense, does it? Let’s take an example,</p>

                <h3>THE IMPERCEPTIBLE SHACKLE</h3>
                <p>I was listening to a song, when suddenly the thought of confessing love by recommending a song or listening it together, came to my mind. Usually people confess their love using words, but is it that important to say “I love you” to confess, cause what you feel is more important than words. But how</p>

                <p>Obstacles, lovely, aren’t they? Don’t they love humans a lot? Humans are beautiful unless ego comes in the way. Years ago I thought people are like a leaf; transparent in younger years and grow opaque with every passing year. I use to believe the opaqueness is what resembles the complexities of a human mind.

                <p>Dear 2020,Flaw, flawless, flawed, perfect, the words usually associated at the start of every year. Welcoming the year with a warm and cherished heart is an age-old tradition for centuries. Fast-forwarding to the end of the last day, last minute, last second of that particular year, there is a coin of life. The hope of</p>
