    <h1>THE IMPERCEPTIBLE SHACKLE</h1>

    <p>I was listening to a song, when suddenly the thought of confessing love by recommending a song or listening it together, came to my mind. Usually people confess their love using words, but is it that important to say “I love you” to confess, cause what you feel is more important than words. But how many people actually confess without words, or maybe you can even say is that even a confession? Disgusting!!!!</p>

    <p>I have always felt a burden in these words. Why? I didn’t know until I realized the bitter side of these words. In this era, these words are a sentence of deprivation of liberty. When someone says these words, I think it means “now you are my possession”. Now you’ll think I am insane, but wait a minute have you observed yourself or when people go on a date. I don’t have any obligations over that, but why pretend?</p>

    <p>Those relationships they show in movies, TV series or in real world, they have always made me uncomfortable and desiring not to be in one. I don’t believe in a love where two persons tend to lose themselves. I believe in a person’s individuality.</p>

    <p>I sighed as I realized this. Realized that I live in a world where peoples are a possession and not individuals. I hate it. I am selfish. Selfish enough to be an individual. They say you have to lose yourself in love. Why would I? Then what’s the point of saying “I love you” when there’s no “I”.</p>

    <p>We live in an age where losing yourself for someone or something is considered as great. We all tend to suffer from this altruism. And fortunately we are able to witness altruism sometimes.</p>

    <p>I am not an altruist. I don’t even want to be. Every person has a different soul, a mind, a nature. If being selfless is everything then why everyone has an individual soul, mind and nature?</p>

    <p>Being selfish doesn’t mean you should harm others for your own profit or anything else in that context. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t help if anyone needs it. Selfishness just means valuing yourself equally you value others.</p>
