        Obstacles, lovely, aren’t they? Don’t they love humans a lot?
Humans are beautiful unless ego comes in the way. Years ago I thought people are like a leaf; transparent in younger years and grow opaque with every passing year. I use to believe the opaqueness is what resembles the complexities of a human mind. And according to myth, complexities are not good. No one loves to solve a complex math problem! But now seeing it in a new light, I understood one thing, humans are puppets controlled by situations they face. And complexities, they are a beautiful product of those situations.
The world has converted humans into puppets a long ago. A puppet that cares for money, social status, fame, and material possessions. But there still beats a human heart that cares, loves, knows money and fame can come and go, relations don’t! We always try to find the real persons around us who don’t just show but really care for us. That’s where obstacles help. So, what say, aren’t they lovely?</p>
<p>Life is as simple as complex it may seem. Live life in moments. Situations occur, unexpectedly and no one is responsible for that. Yet we are responsible for the solutions we create for them. It’s okay to cry, to be sad, to fear. Ain’t this is what life is! We all know we are going to die someday but still, we live like that’s never gonna end. Losing someone doesn’t feel good. It hurts! But that’s not the only thing. It teaches you how to treat people, how to care for them, and most importantly why to love them. Someday we will leave this world and the world will still move on like nothing ever happened. It doesn’t even matter if you have done something worth noticing for the whole world but make sure you stay in those little heart-diaries of people around you so that whenever you are mentioned it just leaves a smile on their faces!</p>
