    <h1>The Ultimate Goal: Peace</h1>

    <p>It’s an irony but true at the same time. We feel like life is eternal. Nah! I’m not going to tell you how shallow life is? Instead, I’m gonna tell you how shallow and deep we are and that too at the same time. Doesn’t seem to make sense, does it? Let’s take an example, everyone wants to find peace. Then what do you do when you want peace. It’s simple, you Google it! And there you go with a lot of ways to experience peace. And let’s say you chose to meditate. Now you have to find a ‘SILENT’ place and sit there with your eyes closed, at most chanting some mantras. Your eyes are closed, so there’s no way you can see something and think about it, your mouth is closed or chanting mantra, so again there’s no way you can think about what you are saying, and the place where you are sitting, is also silent then again there’s no disturbance to your peace. But tell me, are you able to find peace? </p>

       <p> All chaos residing in you gets amplified and you question yourself, “Is this the peace I’m finding?”. But have you thought that there ought to be some purpose of this chaos, specially if they are being amplified while meditating.</p>
        
       <p>What do you do when you are alone and your thoughts are at the peak point. Maybe you put on your earphones and tune in some music; louder enough to make them imperceptible. Congrats! you have successfully suppressed them. But what happens after you tune out, you hear yourself, again and again, this thing continues until you listen to yourself. And that’s why meditation amplifies our thoughts. So that we can go through each of the voices and try to understand what we are saying to ourselves. Isn’t it one of the most efficient ways to find peace? There’s no easy way out. You gotta go, listen to yourself. And yeah! this is where you feel like you are the worst person to exist in this world or you are an imposter or “Why me?”. It’s painful to be in this state. You want to blame yourself or the world or the chaos. But trust me, neither you should look down on yourself nor look down on the world. Neither on chaos nor meditation. Think of it like this, what if you close your eyes and are able to see yourself, hear yourself. Doesn’t matter if you are in a silent place or in a crowd. You are able to behold your beautiful self as well as the world too. The feeling of being clean. </p>
        
        <p> Suppressing the chaos is just like a drug. Can’t agree? Well, when you read those self help books or watch motivational videos, you feel motivated. Sometimes it becomes a way to suppress those thoughts. But when you are alone the thoughts return and you being that ‘drug’ addict, don’t listen to yourself. </p>
        
        <p>Now you will say, “Okay!!! I understood. But what the hell will happen if I hear myself out?”. Now that’s the point of all this. No one is an imposter. No one is different. We all are the same. We all face different types of chaos and no one can escape from that. But between all these chaos, when you can’t find yourself, when you feel like an imposter, when you want to blame the chaos or yourself; keep in mind you are not the chaos, you are not the person the world tells you. Rather you are in a process to find yourself and you are moving towards your real self. And as you proceed, you will know that you, your family, friends, strangers, trees, plants, flowers, thorns, nature, living and non-living things, planets, stars, galaxies and everything that existed, exists and yet to come in existence are one. We all exist simultaneously, in different forms, different kinds and still are a part of singularity. There’s no imposter, no one’s above, no one’s below, we all are on the same page.<p>
        
        <p>  (Evidence:- We all emerged from a single point and that emergence is popularly known as The Big Bang.)</p>
       
        
      <p>And when you are able to feel this, not by reading this but through your own experience. There’s no longer a need of looking for a silent place to sit and meditate for experiencing peace. You will find immense peace, even if you look at a sky full of stars or one with a scorching sun, you will appreciate both. And not only the outer things, when you will look at yourself, you would appreciate each and every thing about you; the past, present as well as the future. You will be able to see yourself, feel yourself with or without meditation, with closed or open eyes, with or without chanting mantras, with or without chaos, with or without a silent place. You will be able to experience peace that will last until your last breath.</p>
