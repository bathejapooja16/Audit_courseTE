    <h1>MOMENTARILY IMMUTABLE</h1>

    <p> Today, while washing clothes, I saw an insect was dying. I thought, ” what is he thinking at his last moment?”
        The insect died but the thought didn’t leave me. What would I think at my last moment?</p>
    <p>We as people always think about our earnings, our status in society, our power, our respect, our hatred, our ego.
        We become so occupied with our stress, tensions, frustrations that we fail to recognize and cherish the happy
        moments that life throws at us. We make our own life enigmatic by such thoughts. We crave for status in society,
        we crave for attention, and because of this hunger, we look down on people who need us. We forget the people
        around us who care for us, who love us. We only concentrate on the ones who hate us, who hurt us. We don’t even
        think of forgiving them. We all know what Virus said in 3 Idiots, ” Remember life is a race, agar tez nahi
        bhagoge to koi tumhe kuchal ke aage nikal jaayega“. We all disagreed with this statement while watching the
        movie. But as the movie ended, the thought disappeared. Again we come back to the race of our life; even if the
        thought of living our life rather than running in a race comes to our mind we discard it saying, ” that’s reel
        life”, without a slight hesitation. Another movie Chhichhore gave the message to cherish every moment of life.
        But we forgot that too. The real problem is we have certain kinds of beliefs and those beliefs are guarded by a
        shield called ego. When something happens against our beliefs, our ego hurts and that becomes a reason to deny
        the truth by beautiful lies of no logical sense. Great people always told us that ego is our greatest enemy.
        Because of ego, we are unable to upgrade our beliefs, our thoughts. When we kill our ego, we are open to think
        with different perspectives, we can understand our own life, we care for people around us and most importantly
        we become more human. And that is what life is all about. Because no matter what your grades are, what your
        social status is, or which college you chose, in the end, the thing that matters is How did you live? Cause, in
        the end, we only remember our happiest moments instead of our grades; in the end, people will remember what type
        of person you were instead of your social status.</p>
    <p>Death has always been a bitter truth. A lot of people are dying because of this pandemic. But looking from a
        different perspective, it has given us the time that we lacked to spend with our loved ones. This time has given
        all of us something positive, whether be it a house full of laughter or be it a lesson. We all have learned
        something, that we would never have been able to with our busy schedules. And at the end; if we want to or not
        but we all agreed to what Naina said – ” Jitna bhi try karo Bunny life mein kuch na kuch toh chootega hi, toh
        jahan hai wahi ka maja lete hai.”</p>
