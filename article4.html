  <p>  Dear 2020,</p>
   <p> Flaw, flawless, flawed, perfect, the words usually associated at the start of every year. Welcoming the year with a warm and cherished heart is an age-old tradition for centuries. Fast-forwarding to the end of the last day, last minute, last second of that particular year, there is a coin of life. The hope of trying to not bow down and the regrets coming from the past. Isn’t this right for at least anyone or everyone? I don’t know, I’ll let you decide.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of anything, you don’t have even the slightest idea of what might come next. The turbulent sense of emotions, expressions, experiences, and most importantly life, all waiting with open arms to be as harsh and wonderful as they could be. The cloud of uncertainty awaiting to shower the thunder, the lightning, the once in a blue moon droplets of love and hugs. You look forward to all of these with a pinch of salt and a bag full of past experiences, right?
    You shocked us with the pandemic. But the things that shocked us more were those situations which we faced throughout the whole year. There were times when we missed our beloved friends, some of us missed their families. Some people lost their jobs, some even lost their lives while some others lost their loved ones. All these forced us to question the existence of everything. Are these materials ours? Do everything we own stays?</p>

   <p> There are a lot of questions like these, we know the answer too, but have we ever accepted that? We are so bound by material possessions, that we often forget our own identity. In our resume of life, we mention that I own this house, I own these mortals, etc. But do we really own these things or these things own us? We were so occupied by our goals, our works, and social status that we forgot our greatest responsibility. Our responsibility to be a human! You taught us humanity. You told us that before someone’s father, mother, daughter, son, boss or worker or anything else, we are a human being. We realized that to help, to serve others is the root purpose of our life. Whether it means helping others or helping ourselves. At some point in life, everyone is hunted down by loneliness. Sometimes there are moments where we find ourselves stuck somewhere and when we look around, we see that the world is moving so fast and then we start to panic. Instead of understanding and hearing our inner voice, that momentary panic forces us to listen to the outer temporary solutions to fix our inherent deep-rooted problems. Dude, you just came and amplified our thoughts that we weren’t eager to hear otherwise. We heard all our tears, all that pain we carried all these times. We heard what our true self wants to tell us. We became compassionate towards ourselves and at the same time towards others. We became warriors! And yeah! along with this strength that you gave us, you made us believe that one can find fun in anything even in a simple activity like watching the news! You showed us that reel life villains can be real-life heroes.</p>

   <p> The death of various famous personalities was a shock but these events taught us that life is just too short to regret over things. Maybe being a little more thankful, spreading a little more love, maybe conserving the child inside us are the real achievements at the end of the day! Thanks for giving us these gifts and well bass ho gaya abb chalo tumhare coffin mein sone ka aur humara coffin dance karne ka samay hai.</p>
